## Introduction
Hi, I'm Mikayla, a new C++ student who loves Hello Kitty. I own my own business and am really enjoying learning C++ so far.

## About Me
I started learning C++ recently and have found it both challenging and rewarding. My passion for Hello Kitty adds a fun touch to my coding journey.

Running my own business has taught me valuable skills that I apply to my C++ studies, such as problem-solving and time management.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on as part of my C++ learning journey. Each project has helped me understand different aspects of the language.

I'm currently working on a project that combines my love for Hello Kitty with my coding skills. Stay tuned for updates!

## Goals
My goal is to become proficient in C++ and use it to develop innovative solutions for my business.

I aim to create a community of Hello Kitty fans who are also interested in coding and technology.

## Contact
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about C++, Hello Kitty, or running a business. I'm always happy to connect with like-minded individuals.
